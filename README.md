# Introduction to TypeScript Presentation

Slides for a presentation at Boston AngularJS Meetup on June 17 2015: An Intro to Typescript with AngularJS. 

The slides are based on a tech talk Ben Smith presented on Friday 12/10/2012 titled "TypeScript: JavaScript for tools" (http://github.com/slashdotdash/typescript-intro-presentation)

Created using the wonderful [deck.js](http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/) for building HTML presentations. Styling has been gratuitously borrowed from [www.typescriptlang.org](http://www.typescriptlang.org/).

A highlight of the slide deck is that each of the TypeScript code snippets shown are compiled to JavaScript on slide navigation using the TypeScript compiler itself. The presentation goes through how to host the compiler within a html page, or view the source of `presentation.html` and `assets/compiler.js` for further details.
